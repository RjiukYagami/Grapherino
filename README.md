Grapherino
==========

OCaml moduls for graphs and graphs typical algorithms.

Main idea of this lib is standardization our work on graphs and implement typical and futher some advanced algorithms.

1. SmallGraph
===========
It's graph that is really fast but he can have maximum 4000 vertices.
It's represented in connection array so we can make every changes in O(1) [const]. 
This graph is perfect for small cases because it's dynamic structure at the same time it has the best complexity possible.
